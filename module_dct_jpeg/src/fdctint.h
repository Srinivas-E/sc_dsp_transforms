/** This function performs zero or more DCT operations, and quantises the
 * result. Each block address is sent to the DCT process over the channel,
 * and when done the address is sent out over the channel. It is streaming
 * so that a block can always be waiting in the channel. This function
 * should be running inside a thread, and is interfaced to through the
 * streaming channel.
 *
 * The quant array should have been preprocessed using the quantDCT function.
 *
 * The functions doDCT and endDCT can be used to interact with the forwardDCT
 * function; if full parallelism is required, then a block address should
 * be sent over the channel, and subsequently a block address should be
 * input for every block address that is output. Some form of double
 * buffering is required to make sure that forwardDCT() "owns" the buffer
 * that it operates on.
 *
 * This function does not return until it receives an 'END' control token
 * over its channel.
 *
 * \param blocks            The channel end to stream addresses of blocks over
