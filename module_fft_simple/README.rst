===========================

:scope: General Use
:description: Simple FFT library
:keywords: DSP, FFT
:boards: 

The FFT module implements a set of functions that can be used to compute
the FFT of a set of complex data points, or the inverse.

Features
--------

  * Code for Foward and Inverse Complex FFT
  * Code to compute two Forward or Inverse real FFTs through a single complex FFT.
  * Bit-twiddle/input reversal function
