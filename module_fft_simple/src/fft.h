/** THis function computes a forward FFT. The complex input array is
 * supplied as two arrays of integers, with numbers represented as
 * fixed-point values. The number of poits must be a power of 2, and the
 * array of sine values should contain a quarter sine-wave.
 *
 * \param re    real part of each input point
 *
 * \param im    imaginary part of each input point
 *
 * \param N     number of points. Must be a power of 2, both re and im should be N long
 *
 * \param sine  array of N/4 sine values, each represented as a sign bit with a 31 bit
 *              fraction. An implicit '1' is added at the end of the array (since +1
 *              cannot be represented) (Hmm - not happy about this, think again)
